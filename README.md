Dirty Hack to extract Stable Diffusion Image Generation Data from generated images


This is really only useful for extracting stable diffusion image generation data from sd generated images.
You will need the python PIL (Pillow) library installed

See here for how to install :https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html
That page lists all its dependancies.
basically its just
                python3 -m pip install --upgrade Pillow 
                
I welcome any efforts to improve this

Cheers
